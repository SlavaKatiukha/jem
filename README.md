# **JEM**
**JEM** is an open source platform component, intended for injection of smart logic into containers. It gives extra abilities and extra automation for applications, designed to be run inside Linux containers.

## **JEM Core**
**JEM Core** is an application, that manages all of the JEM modules and libraries. Also, it does produce the command line interface for calling external functions, provided by application modules.

**JEM Core Libraries** represent a set of common system libraries for handling the operations, that are usually performed by application modules. These libraries comprise number of functions for processing system calls, mathematics, text processing, output processing, suppressing interactivity, testing, executing network-related operations, etc.


## **JEM Common libraries**  (blue-colored)
_**core.lib**_ - basic system library, that implements inheritance, including, trapping, executing, error throwing and other basic system operations.

## **Application Layer Modules**  (green-colored)
**Application Layer Modules** are designed for managing different application stacks inside containers. Such operations can be performed by Jelastic Platform Core or manually, with the help of command line interface. Each application module usually has functions, that are externally available from JEM. In case a module has a list of implementations, needed for different kinds of stacks, it includes specific extra libraries (each of which have unique implementation recipes, created specifically for a particular stack). Functions inside stack libraries are internal and cannot be called other than by parent module of this library.

The list of application modules includes:

_**ssl.module**_ - implements basic functionality for enabling/disabling/configuring SSL certificates for:
* Java application servers: *tomcat*, *glassfish*, *jetty*;
* Load balancer: *nginx*;
* PHP application servers: *httpd* (Apache 2) and *php-fpm* (NGINX-PHP).

It also requires a list of special libraries for managing each application server separately.
